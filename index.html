    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
    In <a href="https://emerald-mdphd.eu/" target="_blank">EMERALD</a> International PhD Programme for Medical Doctors, we train medical doctors in biomedical research to address global health challenges. <br>
    
    One of the biggest challenges in disseminating your research is visualizing the data in a way that is meaningful, easy to interpret and aesthetically pleasing. 
    Oftentimes, the extensive time dedicated to generating experimental results can rival the creation and optimization of their figures. 
    With a point and click environment, you can spend hours or even days tweaking the settings to get the perfect figure - only to realize that you now have to repeat this process for the remaining data. 
    This process can be especially challenging when needing to perform customizations or when pivoting your figures to adhere to guidelines from conferences, journals or other publishing platforms. <br>    
     </p>

    <p>
    This summer school aims to develop and teach fundamental skills needed for advanced <b><span style="color: #b2132e;">Data Visualisation</span></b> techniques through hands-on training.
    We introduce an efficient and reproducible workflow in <b><span style="color: #b2132e;">R</span></b> for creating publication-ready figures. We will introduce ggplot2 syntax to create custom plots, and we will explore how to determine the type of plots most appropriate for your data. 
    We will explore how to ensure consistency between figures using custom theme and color selections, with an emphasis on colorblind-friendly palettes from the RColorBrewer and viridis packages.
    We will also examine methods for enhancing our plots with functions from the ggpubr and cowplot packages, especially regarding layout and labeling of figures. 
    Finally, we will conclude with an activity to use what we have learned to reproduce a published figure.    

        
    This summer school target audience is doctors/researchers/students who have little to no prior computational experience, 
    and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own work/research. <br>
    Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
    </p>
